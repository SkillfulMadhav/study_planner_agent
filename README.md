Smart Study Planner — Multi-Agent AI Scheduler

Problem Statement



Students often struggle to turn large study goals into realistic, day-by-day plans. Manual planning is slow, inconsistent, and rarely optimised.

This project solves that by generating automated study schedules based on tasks, availability, and workload.



Why Agents?



A single LLM is not enough for planning, checking, and refining a schedule.

A multi-agent workflow works far better:



One agent breaks down tasks



One agent builds a schedule



A critic evaluates



A refiner improves until approved



This creates a self-correcting, high-quality schedule.



Architecture Overview

Root Agent (SequentialAgent)



1️⃣ TaskBreakdownAgent – converts user goals into tasks

2️⃣ SchedulingAgent – creates a draft schedule

3️⃣ ScheduleRefinementLoop – repeated critique → improve



Loop Structure



CriticAgent → checks if the schedule is realistic



RefinerAgent → fixes the schedule or approves via exit\_loop()



Custom Tools



compute\_study\_hours()



exit\_loop() (signals loop completion)



Architecture uses:



Sequential agents



Loop agents



Function tools



Gemini models (2.5-flash)



Demo Output



A sample run produces:



Full breakdown of study tasks



A 7-day structured schedule



Improvements + refinements



Final APPROVED schedule
